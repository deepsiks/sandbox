6 Day (Dumbbell) split: 3x2 - Chest & Tri's, Back & Bi's, Legs & Shoulders  
Duration of 60-90 minutes per day. The first muscle group denotes the focus for the given day.  
The Reps & Sets is only a suggestion, always go moderate / non-failure until you know your body.
I typically do pyramid up that begins with a feeder set. Grey = Last set 100% effort, failing on last rep.  
White = hard effort, but not pushing to failure, focus on contractions/squeeze and form.  
Grey Example (for hammer curls): 15lbs x 25(feeder), 30, 40, 45, 50  
White Example (for hammer curls): 15lbs x 25(feeder), 25, 30, 30, 35
